# MiniTerm

The MiniTerm gem is a simple bit of code that seeks to smooth over the bumps
and pot holes encountered when interacting with the console terminal to create
console based CLI applications. More than most it also seeks to eliminate
worries about the nasty cross-platform issues encountered between Windows,
Linux, and MAC OS-X systems.

This code started out its life buried deep within the code of the mini readline
gem where it helped that gem do its job. A while ago it was realized that the
services provided were invaluable for a much wider range of development. I was
increasingly frustrated by my need to "go-around" mini readline to get at some
of its lower level features. When that happens it is a clear sign that a gem is
doing too much and has too many responsibilities.

That's why the low level terminal functionality was split out into the mini
term gem contained in this code repository. At the same time, the lessons
learned from the earlier version of the code have been applied to make this
code better and also not any more incompatible than needed. Since mini readline
was the only "user" of the old code, moving out in some new directions should
not pose a migration issue except for me.

Finally, this gem would not be possible without the excellent insight into the
gnarly world of win_32_api, dl, and fiddle I gained reading and copying the
code in the [ConnorAtherton/rb-readline](https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/rb-readline)
project and gem. *Thank You!*

So, what hurdles do we expect the mini term gem to overcome? What cross-platform
issues vex us? After all, it's not as if Ruby ignores the issue of low-level
console access. It has the io/console and io/wait code libraries. They are
supposed to give low level access right?

And this is the point where the wheels start falling off.

* The io/console library has truly awful documentation. Many methods lack any
sort of description or meaningful parameter names. The developer is left to
reverse engineering the behavior of the code. The programming process borders
on the tribal. In this regard, io/wait is OK. Too bad it only plays a limited
role.

* The io/console library does not work correctly under Windows. And before we
hear a chorus of "Switch to Linux", the anti-windows squad are reminded that
this is a cross-platform tool, just like Ruby is supposed to be. The issue is
that raw mode is not so raw under windows. In fact it's so cooked that it more
resembles a chunk of charcoal! It just plain does not work. Fortunately there
is an answer. Ruby has access to the various APIs though the 'fiddle' gem.
This gem is used to emulate the deprecated 'win32api' gem.

* Under JRuby, the situation is even worse. The io/console facility is
incapable of manipulating the tty or console at all. A true non-starter. Only
here's where things take a twist for the weird. Under Windows, JRuby *does*
support the 'win32api' gem. It even works! I'm not at all sure how to support
JRuby under Linux or Mac OS-X.

* Working with Rubinius is perhaps the worst of all. Rubinius *still* does not
run under Windows. Until such time as I am able to develop under a supported
platform, or can collaborate with someone who can, this is a non-starter. Don't
stay tuned, don't hold your breath; This problem is going away any time soon.

#### So! What do we have?

This is a matrix of language versions and environments that have are tested or
have been tested at one time or another.

Ruby           | Win32   | Win64   | Cygwin  | Linux   | Mac
---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------
ruby 2.1.6p336 | Yes?    | Yes??   | Yes??   | Yes??   | Yes??
ruby 2.2.3p173 | Yes??   | Yes??   | Yes?    | Yes??   | Yes??
ruby 2.3.3p222 | Yes??   | Yes     | Yes??   | Yes??   | Yes??
jruby 9.1.5.0  | Yes?    | Yes??   | Maybe?  | Maybe?  | Maybe?

This table will be updated as more information becomes available. Check the
[github  repository](https://github.com/PeterCamilleri/mini_term) for the
latest info.

Notes:
* Mini term uses keyword parameters so Ruby 2.0 or later is required. This is
why older versions of Ruby have been removed from this table.
* Yes? means that this combination was once tested with very similar code and
should be OK, we hope. Testing would be nice.
* Yes?? means that this combination *should* work but needs testing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mini_term'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mini_term

## Usage

The mini term can be used in a project requiring low level access by:

```ruby
require 'mini_term'
```

Before it can be used, the mini term should be opened. This is done with:

```ruby
MiniTerm.open
```

The open method can take some optional arguments:

    quiet: true         # Suppress the message on forced close.
    quiet: false        # (Default) On forced close, display a message.

    pass_ctrl_s: true   # The control s character is passed through.
    pass_ctrl_s: false  # (Default) The control s character is used by the OS

    pass_ctrl_c: true   # The control c character is passed through.
    pass_ctrl_c: false  # (Default) The control c character is used by the OS

#### Exceptions:

The mini term gem uses the following exception classes:

    Exception              # From Ruby.
      StandardError        # From Ruby.
        MiniTermError      # The abstract base exception for mini term.
          MiniTermWTF      # An internal error happened. This shouldn't happen.
          MiniTermNoMap    # No map can be found for the current terminal type.
          MiniTermKME      # A keyboard mapping error was detected.
