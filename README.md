# MiniTerm

The MiniTerm gem is a simple bit of code that seeks to smooth over the bumps
and pot holes encountered when interacting with the console terminal to create
console based CLI applications. This code started out buried deep within the
MiniReadline gem where it helped that gem do its job. A while ago it was
realized that the services provided where invaluable for a much wider range of
development.

That's why this functionality was split out into the mini term gem contained in
this code repository.

        MiniTermError      # The abstract base exception for mini term.
          MiniTermWTF      # An internal error happened. This shouldn't happen.
