# MiniTerm - Utilities and Demos

This section describes the simple utilities and demo programs that are included
with the mini_term gem. The applications are designed to ease writing and
testing of programs using mini_term. Then again, some are just for fun.

## mini_term_blizzard

The other programs bundled with mini_term are serious practical utilities. They
all serve a purpose. The mini_term_blizzard is none of those things! When run,
it fills the console screen with _snow_.

Yup

Snow!

If run with no arguments, it uses the asterisk ("*") for the snowflakes. It can
also take hex arguments that are the code point, or range of code points to be
used. The following looks really nice on my test machine:

## raw_key_test

This program is intended as a means to explore the key codes generated by the
keyboard. This will help in the process of designing a MiniTerm map or the
custom code to directly handle user input.

The program works by taking raw data from the keyboard and simply displaying it
in hex format. The program exits when the character "Q" is entered.

A sample run of this program, under Windows is shown below. In this example the
keys entered were "1234567890 *F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10 F11 F12* qQ"
where *F1* through *F12* represent the keyboard's "F" keys and spaces are added
only for clarity and where not entered.
